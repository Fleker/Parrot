Parrot
======

Parrot is a super easy to use forum solution that's build to be fast, secure, and simple. It's so quick to install that you'll finally have time to feed Poly that cracker.

Use
===

Currently Parrot is in the development stage. This means that even though you can use it on your server, it's still going to be missing quite a bit of features. I'd recommend waiting a while. Maybe even check out [this parrot](http://bit.ly/1jnMQ6S). If you still want to install, though, just download as ZIP and extract to any directory on your server you want, run the lightning fast installer, and start posting!

Contributing
=========

Parrot will never be done. It'll always be getting improvements, updated documentation, and more users. If you'd like to help create the future of community discussion, just start coding! If you don't know how to code, I'm always looking for designers for theme layouts and icons. Head over to the [wiki](http://github.com/Codingbean/Parrot/wiki/Contribute) for a list of needed jobs and instructions.
